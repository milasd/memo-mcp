Christmas morning felt different this year - quieter, more reflective. Instead of the usual chaos of extended family gatherings, it was just Mom, Dad, and me around the tree. Grandma is doing well after her treatment, but she's still recovering, so we kept things small and peaceful. There was something beautiful about the simplicity of it all - homemade cinnamon rolls, terrible Christmas movies, and the kind of easy conversation that only happens when there's nowhere else to be.

The best gift I received wasn't wrapped under the tree. It was the moment when Dad pulled out his old guitar and started playing the Christmas songs he used to sing when I was little. Mom and I joined in, our voices rusty but enthusiastic, and for a few minutes, it felt like we'd traveled back in time. I realized how rare these moments are becoming as we all get older and busier, and how precious they are because of their rarity.

As I write this, snow is falling outside my childhood bedroom window, and I can hear my parents laughing in the kitchen as they clean up from dinner. This year has been full of ups and downs, challenges and growth, but sitting here now, I feel overwhelmingly grateful. Not just for the big things - health, family, opportunities - but for the small moments that make up a life. Tomorrow I'll drive back to my apartment and my routine, but tonight I'm exactly where I need to be.
