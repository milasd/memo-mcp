The apartment viewing this morning was a disaster, but somehow I'm laughing about it now. The landlord showed up twenty minutes late, reeking of cigarettes and making excuses about traffic. When he finally opened the door, I was greeted by the sight of the previous tenant's belongings still scattered everywhere - dirty dishes in the sink, unmade bed, even a half-eaten sandwich on the counter. The "recently renovated" bathroom had a gaping hole in the wall where the medicine cabinet used to be.

But the worst part was when I asked about the strange brown stains on the ceiling, and he casually mentioned that the upstairs neighbor's bathtub had been leaking for months. "Nothing a little paint can't fix," he said with a shrug, as if water damage was just a minor cosmetic issue. I politely thanked him for his time and practically sprinted out of there, already mentally crossing it off my list.

The whole experience reminded me why apartment hunting is so exhausting, but it also made me appreciate my current place more. Sure, my roommate leaves dishes in the sink and the heating is inconsistent, but at least the ceiling isn't actively falling apart. Sometimes you don't realize how good you have it until you see how much worse it could be. Tomorrow I'm viewing three more places - hopefully with landlords who understand basic property maintenance.
