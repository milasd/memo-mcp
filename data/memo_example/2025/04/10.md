I can't stop thinking about the phone call I received this morning. Dad's voice was shaky when he told me about Grandma's diagnosis, and I could hear Mom crying in the background. Cancer. The word just hung in the air between us, heavy and terrifying. She's always been the strongest person I know - the one who held our family together through every crisis, who never missed a birthday or graduation, who taught me how to make her famous apple pie.

The drive to their house felt endless. When I finally got there, Grandma was sitting in her garden, tending to her roses as if nothing had changed. She hugged me tighter than usual and whispered that everything would be okay, but I could see the fear in her eyes. We spent the afternoon looking through old photo albums, and she told me stories I'd never heard before about her childhood and how she met Grandpa.

Tonight, I'm trying to process this new reality. The doctors say the prognosis is good if they catch it early, but the uncertainty is overwhelming. I want to be strong for my family, but I also need to allow myself to feel scared. Grandma always said that courage isn't the absence of fear - it's feeling afraid and choosing to keep going anyway.
