The first day of my pottery class was both humbling and exhilarating. I've been putting this off for months, always finding excuses about being too busy or too clumsy with my hands. But watching the instructor, Elena, shape clay into something beautiful with such ease made me realize how much I've been missing. My first attempt at a bowl looked more like a sad, lopsided ashtray, but Elena just smiled and said, "Every master was once a disaster."

There were eight of us in the class, ranging from a retired teacher to a college student to a businessman who admitted he was there on his therapist's recommendation. We were all terrible in our own unique ways, which somehow made it perfect. The businessman's mug collapsed entirely, and we all erupted in laughter - including him. There's something deeply satisfying about working with your hands, feeling the clay respond to your touch, even when it doesn't cooperate.

I left with clay under my fingernails and a sense of accomplishment I haven't felt in months. It doesn't matter that my bowl is wonky or that I'll probably never be good at this. What matters is that I tried something new, stepped outside my comfort zone, and discovered a part of myself I didn't know existed. I'm already looking forward to next week's class and the beautiful disasters I'll create.
