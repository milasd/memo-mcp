Independence Day has always been my favorite holiday, but this year feels especially meaningful. I'm finally living alone for the first time in my adult life, and there's something liberating about hosting my own barbecue in my tiny backyard. The guest list was small - just a few close friends and my neighbor Mrs. Chen, who brought the most incredible homemade dumplings. We grilled burgers, played terrible music too loudly, and laughed until our stomachs hurt.

As the sun set, we all piled onto my fire escape to watch the fireworks over the city. Marcus brought his guitar, and we sang along to old songs we barely remembered the words to. There was this moment when the biggest firework exploded overhead, painting all our faces in gold and red light, and I felt this overwhelming sense of contentment. This is what happiness looks like - not the grand gestures or major milestones, but these simple moments of connection and joy.

Later, after everyone had gone home and I was cleaning up the paper plates and empty bottles, I realized how much I've grown this year. Six months ago, the thought of hosting anything would have terrified me. Now I'm already planning my next gathering. Independence isn't just about freedom from something - it's about the freedom to create the life you want, one small celebration at a time.
