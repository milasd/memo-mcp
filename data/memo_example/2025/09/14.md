The wedding was absolutely magical, but it also stirred up emotions I wasn't expecting. Watching my college roommate Emma walk down the aisle in her grandmother's dress, radiant with joy, made me incredibly happy for her. She and David are perfect together - you can see it in the way they look at each other, like they're sharing a secret that only they understand. The ceremony was intimate and heartfelt, and I may have cried during their vows.

But as the night went on and I found myself sitting alone at the singles table, watching all the couples dance, I couldn't shake this feeling of loneliness. It's not that I'm not happy with my life - I am. I love my independence, my career is finally on track, and I have amazing friends. But there's something about weddings that makes you acutely aware of what's missing. When they played "At Last" and I saw Emma's grandparents slow dancing, married for sixty years, I felt this deep ache for that kind of partnership.

I ended up leaving early, claiming I had an early morning, but really I just needed to be alone with these feelings. Love will come when it comes, I know that. But sometimes the waiting feels heavier than others, and tonight is one of those times. Tomorrow I'll wake up grateful for my beautiful, complicated, single life. Tonight, I'm allowing myself to feel the longing.
