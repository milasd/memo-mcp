I've been struggling to find my rhythm at work lately, and today really drove that point home. I sat at my desk for what felt like hours, staring at the same email draft, rewriting the same paragraph over and over. My brain felt like it was moving through molasses - every task that should have taken minutes stretched into an hour. The irony is that I have so much on my plate right now, but I can't seem to make meaningful progress on any of it.

The worst part was the team standup meeting where everyone else seemed to have clear updates and accomplishments to share. When it was my turn, I fumbled through a vague explanation of "research and planning," which felt like code for "I've been spinning my wheels." I could see the slight furrow in my manager's brow, and I don't blame her. If I were in her position, I'd be concerned too.

I think part of the problem is that I've been trying to multitask everything instead of focusing deeply on one thing at a time. Tomorrow, I'm going to try a different approach - blocking out chunks of time for specific projects and turning off all notifications. Maybe what I need isn't more hours in the day, but better use of the hours I have. Sometimes the solution isn't working harder, but working smarter.
