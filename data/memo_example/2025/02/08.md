The argument with Sarah today left me feeling completely drained. We've been best friends for over a decade, and I never thought we'd have a fight this intense. It started over something so trivial - plans for her birthday party - but somehow escalated into this massive confrontation about how we've been growing apart. The worst part is that she's not entirely wrong.

I've been so caught up in my own world lately that I haven't been the friend she deserves. When she accused me of being selfish and distant, it stung because there was truth in it. I tried to defend myself, but the words came out all wrong, and before I knew it, we were both saying things we didn't mean. She stormed out of the caf√©, leaving me sitting there with two untouched lattes and a table full of regret.

I keep replaying the conversation in my head, wondering if I should text her or give her space. Part of me wants to rush over with flowers and apologies, but another part of me is still hurt by some of the things she said. Maybe we both need time to cool down and reflect on what our friendship really means to us.
