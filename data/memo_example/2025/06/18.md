The job interview today was a complete disaster, and I'm still cringing thinking about it. I prepared for weeks, researched the company inside and out, and even practiced my answers in the mirror. But when I walked into that conference room and saw the panel of five intimidating executives, my mind went completely blank. I stumbled through my introduction, forgot the name of my current supervisor, and somehow managed to spill coffee on my resume.

The worst part was when they asked about my biggest weakness, and instead of giving the polished answer I'd rehearsed, I blurted out that I sometimes cry during sad commercials. The silence that followed felt like an eternity. I tried to recover with a joke, but it only made things more awkward. By the time I left, I was convinced I'd never work in this industry again.

But as I sat in my car afterward, something shifted. Maybe this wasn't the right opportunity for me anyway. Maybe the universe is trying to tell me something about the path I'm on. I've been so focused on climbing the corporate ladder that I've forgotten to ask myself if it's even a ladder I want to climb. Tonight, I'm going to order pizza, watch a terrible movie, and start thinking about what I actually want from my career - not what I think I should want.
