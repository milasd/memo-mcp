Halloween has always been my favorite holiday, and this year I went all out with my costume - a 1920s flapper complete with beaded dress and feather headband. The office party was a blast, and I won second place in the costume contest (losing only to Jim from accounting, who somehow transformed into a convincing vampire). But the real highlight was trick-or-treating with my neighbor's kids, Sophie and Max, when their babysitter canceled last minute.

I haven't spent Halloween with children in years, and I'd forgotten how magical it is to see the world through their eyes. Sophie, dressed as a superhero, approached every house with the confidence of someone who truly believed she could fly. Max, a tiny dinosaur, roared at every decoration and collected candy with the seriousness of a scientist gathering specimens. Their pure joy was infectious, and I found myself getting just as excited about the houses with full-size candy bars.

As we walked through the neighborhood, admiring the elaborate decorations and comparing candy hauls, I realized how much I miss having that sense of wonder and possibility. Somewhere along the way, I stopped believing in magic - not the supernatural kind, but the everyday magic of new experiences and simple pleasures. Tonight reminded me that it's never too late to reclaim that childlike enthusiasm for life's small adventures.
